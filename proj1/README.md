# G-Lang
This is my own project to create an interpreter for a made up language I call "G-lang". 

For my undergraduate I have had to create a similar project in Python, however this time around I wish to implement the language in C++.

After taking my compiler class I wish to create a compiler for the language as well. 

This is just a project to expand my academic understanding of programming languages. This language has no intended use outside of that. 

# Goals as of 9/13/17
------------------------------------------

Get file reader working ~ Working to a basic degree

Allow for command line arguments from terminal ~ Working

I.e: "G-lang "test_file.g" "

Implement basic syntax types

Upload basic language documentation and use of language 

------------------------------------------

As I am a full time student, this project will recieve as much attention as I can give it during the academic year. 

# Note
A question was asked if I was building this because I found the C++ syntax inadequte. That isn't the case at all. In fact I would say C++ is my favorite high level language to use, since it was the first one I learned. The purpose of this language is soley academic, and not because I have a probelms with C++.
